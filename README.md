# Marvel Remix Scoring

This is an unofficial application for scoring the [Marvel Remix](https://wizkids.com/marvel-remix/) card game. It is inspired by the similar scoring app for Fantasy Realms, the [Fantasy Realms App of Scoring](https://fantasy-realms.github.io/index.html) 

All images and characters used are property of WizKids or The Walt Disney Company.

## Building and Running
